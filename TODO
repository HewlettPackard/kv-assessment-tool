  - add logic to remove module via module_delete() via syscall()
  - DONE

* dsr_01232105

  - define test cases

  - investigate implications of preventing kernel calls to get_user_pages()
  - DONE

* dsr_01232105

  - document how to run mmsearch against the cred-card-app
  - DONE

* dsr_01232105

  - code fixup on logic to read contents of pmap. Reduce the amount

  - DONE

* dsr_01232105

  - add opensource licensing
  - DONE

* dsr_03042016

  - accept a container PID and map it to its kernel PID. Current
    workaround is to use --pid=host on the docker run commandline.

* dsr_06072016

  - replace current build with autotools

* dsr_06072016

  - run mmsearch as a kernel thread rather than in process

* dsr_06072016

  - maybe the framework should be in python rather than C

* dsr_06072016

  - docment mmsearch internals and the issues which it is intended to
    demonstrate
