overview
--------

A firewall between process user space memory and the kernel is
impractical.

The kernel supports a number of data movement APIs explicitly to copy
data from user space to kernel space and kernel space to user
space. As well as routines to clear process memory areas.

These routines are used by many drivers.

E. g. get_user(), put_user(), clear_user(). copy_to_user(),
copy_from_user(), strlen_user(), strncpy_from_user(). All of which are
required for the normal operation of the kernel as it manages and
responds to process management system calls.

	mm/gup.c	//get user page...
